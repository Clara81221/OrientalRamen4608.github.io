    <h3>RamenPy? What's that?</h3>
    <dateinfo>11/28/2020 2:36AM - Entry #10</dateinfo>
    <p>
    RamenPy is my new discord bot I'm developing. It's just a beginner's bot. I'm writing it in Python instead of making it in Discord Bot Maker like my last bot. It may someday be robust. HAHA, yeah right. I'll probably make a Github page for it soon.

    <h3>Why is this a hidden site</h3>

    <p>
    You may be asking yourself, why is this blog site hidden? Well it's about to... Not be. By the time you see this it will likely be public.

    <p>
    I'm part of many things- Hopefully Impulsive Studios and Impulsive Earth happens. I'm also part of Headless Studios. No other member has EVER uploaded ANYTHING to the channel. I've got a lot to handle on my end- I'm working on it! I have my Day Starter for personal use, it starts my day with a Nirvana song and all of the websites I visit to check notifications. Basically, in typical 13 year old fashion, I created a script to run a bunch of websites and play Nirvana. You can always Discord me @ Ramen#4608. Thank you for the continued support and I'll write again in... Well, a couple of minutes.

    <h3>Unus Annus repos?</h3>
    <dateinfo>11/28/2020 2:29AM - Entry #7</dateinfo>
    <p>
    Yes, there are Unus Annus repos on my profile. The one is for a tribute, with a few moments from Unus Annus. The other is a website I'm desperately trying to make but failing horribly. It's supposed to show the days since Unus Annus died. I don't think they'll be changed- Probably deleted due to letting go of it... It's hard, though.

    <h3>What's next for RamenOS</h3>
    <dateinfo>11/28/2020 2:26AM - Entry #6</dateinfo>
    <p>
    I made you think it was dead. It is not. I'm planning to bring it back as RamenOS "Rebirth" and I'm going to make it a command processor with more features and a Ramen atmosphere. Maybe a part of the multitool one day

    <h3>RamenOS - What the HELL is that?</h3>
    <dateinfo>11/28/2020 2:25AM - Entry #5</dateinfo>
    <p>
    Oh boy... I made a custom "os" if you can really call it that. It was a really fun learning project but in the end, it was a mess. It is no longer updated- I should label it desserted.

    <h3>What is Flavor Packet?</h3>
    <dateinfo>11/28/2020 2:23AM - Entry #4</dateinfo>
    <p>
    Ah, my old project. Flavor packet was a Discord bot that I loved. I made it with Discord Bot Maker and I had so many features planned. But I never really finished it. You can still download it from my git page. Obviously it was called flavour pack because I'm ramen, and it sucks to have ramen without a flavor pack.

    <h3>What happened to ggroups.exe?</h3>
    <dateinfo>11/28/2020 2:21AM - Entry #3</dateinfo>
    <p>
    What the hell happened to ggroups.exe, the SUPERHOT messenger? Well, the truth is it's out of my ball park. I can't complete it. Maybe I'll bring on a team some day. It is in a state that does not work at all.

    What's going on with my website? Well, right now I'm making this blog. How are you here right now? This is in development as we speak. I'll add most of my projects before I make links.

    <h3>Project Multitool</h3>
    <dateinfo>11/28/2020 2:05AM - Entry #1</dateinfo>
    <p>
    I've had this in development for a while, as well as a lovely couple of people, mainly just Klaymer and Val Kir. Recently, we've merged our multitools and have been co-developing a more robust combination of the two. Currently, we're on version... I don't know, but we're working on it. You can contact me if you want to help. It's a multitool with many useful tools and links all rolled into one, why else would it be called a multitool? You do need login info from me, discord me @ Ramen#4608 or find other contact info on my website. I usually reply pretty fast, and I'll make you your own login.
