    <h3>Project Multitool - Entry #1</h3>
    <dateinfo>11/28/2020 2:05AM</dateinfo>
    <p>
    I've had this in development for a while, as well as a lovely couple of people, mainly just Klaymer and Val Kir. Recently, we've merged our multitools and have been co-developing a more robust combination of the two. Currently, we're on version... I don't know, but we're working on it. You can contact me if you want to help. It's a multitool with many useful tools and links all rolled into one, why else would it be called a multitool? You do need login info from me, discord me @ Ramen#4608 or find other contact info on my website. I usually reply pretty fast, and I'll make you your own login.
