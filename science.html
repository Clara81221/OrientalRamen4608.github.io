    <h1>What is a mineral?</h1>
    <p>
 A mineral is a naturally occurring, inorganic solid<br>
 that has a crystal structure and definite chemical<br>
 composition. For a substance to be a mineral, it<br>
 must have all five of these characteristics.<br>
    </p>
<h1>Naturally Occurring</h1>
    <p>
 To be classified as a mineral, a substance must be<br>
 formed by a process in the natural world. The mineral<br>
 quartz forms naturally as a molten material cools and<br>
 hardens deep beneath Earth's surface. Materials made <br>
 by people, such as plastic, brick, glass, and steel, <br>
 are not minerals.
    </p>
<h1>Inorganic</h1>
<p>
 A mineral also must be inorganic. This means that the<br>
 Mineral cannot form from materials that were once part<br>
 of a living thing. For example, coal forms naturally in<br>
 the crust. But geologists do not classify coal as a<br>
 mineral because it comes from the remains of plants that<br>
 lived millions of years ago<br>
 </p>
<h1>Solid</h1>
<p>
 A mineral is always a solid, with a definite volume and<br>
 shape. The particles that make up a solid are packed<br>
 together very tightly, so they cannot move like the<br>
 particles that make up a liquid.<br>
 </p>
<h1>Crystal Structure</h1>
<p>
 The particles of a mineral line up in a pattern that<br>
 repeats over and over again. The repeating pattern<br>
 has flat sides, called faces, that meet up at sharp<br>
 edges and corners. Quartz has a crystal structure.<br>
 In contrast, most coal lacks a crystal structure.<br>
 </p>
<h1>Definite Chemical composition</h1>
<p>
 A mineral has a definite chemical composition or range<br>
 of compositions. This means a mineral always contains<br>
 certain elements in definite proportions.<br>
	Almost all minerals are compounds. For example,<br>
 a crystal of all the mineral quartz has one atom of<br>
 silicon for every two atoms of oxygen. Each compound has<br>
 its own properties, or characteristics which usually<br>
 differ greatly from the properties of elements that form<br>
 it.<br>
	Some elements occur in nature in a pure form, and<br>
 not as part of a compound with other elements. Elements<br>
 such as copper, silver, and gold are also minerals. Almost<br>
 all pure, solid elements are metals.<br>
