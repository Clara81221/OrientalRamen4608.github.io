<p>Welcome to my website. Credit of the CSS design and all of that, basically a template, to Impulse#7647. I'm Ramen. Gaming, lots of food, memes and some youtube sprinkled in on the top. Currently obsessed with SUPERHOT. (Welcome to the club) I have a cringy youtube channel with cringy content and cringy friends who never upload. Buuuuuuut, I have 10.6K karma on Reddit, so that's kinda cool. No tik tok, no fortnite, they are bad. I hate everything about fortnite, but only the community of tik tok. If the app could have a better community, I think i'd like it, but it's just 14 year old girls Lip syncing to shitty songs. I have a drone, see my discord at social links if you wanna see footage. This website gets cringier the more I type. Please help me.</p>
